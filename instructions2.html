</p><p>In this assignment, you will continue your journey with MongoDB
and Mongoose. You will then create two new schemas for promotions and
leadership, and then extend the Express REST API server to support
the /promotions and the /leaders REST API end points.</p>
<p>Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions</p>
<p><strong>Assignment Overview</strong></p>
<p>At the end of this assignment you would have completed the
following three tasks:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Implemented the Promotions
	schema and model</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Implement a REST API to support
	the /promotions endpoint, and the /promotions/:promoId endpoint
	enabling the interaction with the MongoDB database</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Implemented the Leaders schema
	and model</p>
	<li/>
<p>Implement a REST API to support the /leaders endpoint, and
	the /leaders/:leaderId endpoint enabling the interaction with the
	MongoDB database</p>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assignment Requirements</strong></p>
<p>This assignment consists of the following two tasks:</p>
<p><strong>Task 1</strong></p>
<p>You are given the following example of a promotion document. You
will now create the Promotions schema and model to support the
document:</p>
<p>Note in particular that the label and price fields should be
implemented the same way as you did for the Dishes schema and model.
The Promotions schema and model should be defined in a file named
<em>promotions.js</em>.</p>
<p>Next, extend the <em>promoRouter.js</em> to enable the interaction
with the MongoDB database to fetch, insert, update and delete
information.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2</strong></p>
<p>You are given the following example of a leadership document. You
will now create the Leaders schema and model to support the document:</p>
<p>The Leaders schema and model should be defined in a file named
<em>leaders.js</em>.</p>
<p>Next, extend the <em>leaderRouter.js</em> to enable the
interaction with the MongoDB database to fetch, insert, update and
delete information.</p>
